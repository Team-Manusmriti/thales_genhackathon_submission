## 4. Competitive Landscape

### Major Cloud-Based Players

- **Google Assistant / Gemini**: Powerful integration, but entirely cloud-based → data privacy risk.
- **Amazon Alexa**: Smart home/shopping oriented; still cloud-reliant.
- **Apple Siri & Apple Intelligence**: Hybrid approach (on-device + “Private Cloud Compute”). More private than rivals but not fully offline → opening for 100% on-device competitors.

### Privacy-First Competitors

- **Layla AI**: $19.99 offline chatbot, limited capabilities.
- **Survivalist.AI**: $7.99 offline, knowledge-focused.
- **Eris**: Open-source, developer-oriented.
- **Lumo AI / BusinessGPT**: Privacy promises, but browser-based.

**Differentiation:**  
Most privacy-first competitors are **“offline chatbots.”**  
A next-gen **on-device intelligent agent** (voice + RAG on local docs + computer vision) stands out as a **new category**, bridging beyond Q&A into real-world action.

---

## 5. Target Market Segments

### Privacy-Conscious Professionals

- Lawyers, doctors, researchers working with confidential data.
- Need offline AI to comply with **HIPAA, GDPR**.
